1. Convert String Inputs to Integers and Calculate Sum:

Write a program that takes five string inputs from the user, converts them to integers, and prints the sum.

2. Fahrenheit to Celsius Converter:

Create a function that converts Fahrenheit to Celsius. Take temperature input from the user and display the result with two decimal places.

3. Integer to Float Conversion and Average Calculation:

Take three integer inputs from the user, convert them to floats, and calculate the average using a function.

4. Boolean to Integer Conversion:

Write a function that converts a boolean value to an integer (true -> 1, false -> 0). Take user input as "true" or "false" and convert it.

5. Convert Float to Integer and Check Even/Odd:

Take a float input from the user, convert it to an integer, and determine whether the resulting integer is even or odd.

6. Hexadecimal to Decimal Converter:

Ask the user to enter a hexadecimal string (e.g., "1A"), convert it to an integer, and display the decimal equivalent.

7. Iterate Over a Slice of Strings and Convert to Integers:

Given a slice of string numbers ([]string{"10", "20", "30", "40"}), write a program to convert them into integers and calculate their total sum.

8. String to Float Conversion with Error Handling:

Take a string input representing a floating-point number, convert it to a float, and print the square of the number. Handle any conversion errors.

9. Read Multiple Values and Convert Types:

Read an integer, a float, and a string from the user. Convert the integer to a float and the float to an integer, then display the converted values.

10. Character to ASCII Value Converter:

Prompt the user to enter a single character, convert it to its ASCII integer value, and print the result.
